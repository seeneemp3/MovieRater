## Technologies

- Spring Boot
- Maven
- REST API
- SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java)

The application is developed using Spring Boot and built with Maven. It uses an H2 database to store essential entities such as users, movies, and genres.

> About H2 Database
> H2 is a lightweight, embedded SQL database written in Java. It is ideal for development and testing purposes, as it can be easily integrated into Java applications and provides an in-memory database option.



## REST API
